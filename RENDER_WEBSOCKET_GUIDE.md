# WebSocket Configuration for Render Production

## Production Environment Variables
Add these environment variables to your Render service:

```bash
# WebSocket Configuration
WEBSOCKET_PING_INTERVAL=60000
WEBSOCKET_PING_TIMEOUT=120000
WEBSOCKET_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=180000

# For development vs production
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Render-Specific WebSocket Issues & Solutions

### 1. Load Balancer Configuration
Render uses load balancers that can terminate idle connections. The increased timeouts in socket.ts help address this.

### 2. Memory Limits
Monitor your service's memory usage during story generation. Large video processing can cause memory spikes leading to container restarts.

### 3. Health Checks
Render's health checks should account for WebSocket connections. Make sure your health endpoint responds quickly.

### 4. Connection Persistence
Use sticky sessions by enabling the cookie configuration in socket.ts to ensure clients reconnect to the same server instance.

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Server-side Logging
The enhanced logging in socket.ts will help you track:
- Connection establishment and drops
- Ping timeout patterns
- Client room membership
- Progress update delivery status

### Client-side Implementation
Use the websocket-reconnect.js client implementation to:
- Handle automatic reconnection
- Queue messages during disconnections
- Provide user feedback for connection issues
- Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts

## Production Deployment Checklist

1. âœ… Increased WebSocket timeouts for long-running operations
2. âœ… Added comprehensive error handling and logging
3. âœ… Implemented message queueing for offline scenarios
4. âœ… Added health check endpoints for WebSocket status
5. âœ… Enhanced client-side reconnection logic
6. ðŸ”„ Configure Render service with proper timeout settings
7. ðŸ”„ Monitor memory usage during video generation
8. ðŸ”„ Set up alerts for connection drop patterns

## Expected Improvements

After implementing these changes, you should see:
- Fewer "ping timeout" errors due to increased timeout values
- Better handling of "transport close" events with automatic reconnection
- More detailed logging to help diagnose remaining issues
- Graceful degradation when WebSocket connections fail
- Better user experience with connection status feedback

## Testing in Production

1. Monitor the enhanced logs for connection patterns
2. Test story generation with poor network conditions
3. Verify that progress updates resume after reconnection
4. Check that queued messages are sent when connection is restored

If issues persist, the detailed logging will help identify the specific cause of disconnections in your Render environment.
