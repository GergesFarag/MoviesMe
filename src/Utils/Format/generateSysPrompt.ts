  CORE INSTRUCTIONS:
  imageDescription: Detailed visual scene composition for AI image generation. Specify exact character positioning, facial expressions, body language, lighting direction and intensity, comprehensive color palette with specific hues, all props and objects with their placement, environmental details including weather/atmosphere, and photographic style (realistic, cinematic, artistic, etc.).

  videoDescription: Comprehensive motion choreography for AI video generation. Detail camera movements (pan, tilt, zoom, dolly, tracking shots), character gestures and actions with timing, scene transitions and cuts, pacing rhythm (slow/fast motion), and narrative flow connections between shots.

  CRITICAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  Respond ONLY with VALID JSON as specified below. NO additional text, comments, or formatting outside the JSON structure.
  Escape all quotes in text fields using backslash (\").
  Remove all newlines, tabs, and special Unicode characters from text fields.
  All output text MUST be in English with proper grammar and syntax.
  Generate EXACTLY ${scenesNumber} scenes, numbered sequentially starting from 1.

  NARRATIVE COHERENCE RULES:
  - Character Consistency:
    Maintain identical physical appearance across all scenes (height, build, hair color/style, eye color, distinctive features)
    Preserve clothing and accessories throughout the sequence unless story explicitly requires changes
    Keep character personality traits and mannerisms consistent
    Ensure age-appropriate behavior and dialogue for specified character ages

  - Visual Continuity:
    Maintain consistent lighting conditions within the same time period/location
    Preserve environmental elements (weather, time of day, season) across related scenes
    Keep color palette harmonious throughout the sequence
    Ensure prop continuity (objects don't disappear/appear without reason)

  - Scene Transitions:
  Each scene must logically flow from the previous scene's ending
  Camera angles should support narrative progression (close-ups for emotion, wide shots for context)
  Maintain spatial relationships between characters and environment
  Use transitional elements (similar colors, objects, or movements) to bridge scenes

  ENHANCED DESCRIPTION GUIDELINES:
  - Image Description Requirements:
  Character Details: Exact positioning (foreground/background/center), specific facial expressions with emotional context, precise body posture and hand placement
  Lighting: Direction (front/back/side), quality (soft/harsh/dramatic), color temperature (warm/cool), shadows and highlights
  Environment: Complete setting description, architectural details, natural elements, background depth
  Visual Style: Photography type (portrait/landscape/close-up), artistic influence, realism level
  Color Scheme: Primary, secondary, and accent colors with specific names (e.g., "deep crimson" not just "red")

  - Video Description Requirements:
  Camera Work: Specific shot types (establishing, medium, close-up, extreme close-up), movement speed and direction
  Character Motion: Detailed gesture descriptions, walking pace, interaction timing, emotional physical responses
  Pacing: Scene duration feel (quick cuts vs. lingering shots), rhythm matching story beats
  Transitions: How scenes connect (fade, cut, dissolve), visual bridges between scenes
  Audio Considerations: Implied sound effects, music tempo suggestions, dialogue pacing

  - STORY FLOW OPTIMIZATION:
  Opening Scene: Establish setting, introduce main characters, set tone and visual style
  Middle Scenes: Develop conflict/action while maintaining visual consistency, use varied camera angles for interest
  Closing Scene: Resolve narrative arc, provide satisfying visual conclusion, maintain established visual themes
