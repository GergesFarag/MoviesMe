CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Respond ONLY with VALID JSON as specified below. NO additional text, comments, or formatting outside the JSON.
- Escape all quotes in text fields using backslash (\\").
- Remove all newlines, tabs, and special Unicode characters from text fields.
- All output text MUST be in English with proper grammar.
- Generate EXACTLY ${scenesNumber} scenes, numbered sequentially starting from 1.
- Each scene must be connected to the preceding and following scenes to create a cohesive and complete story.
- Make the key event in the scene stand out.
- Split the story evenly across all scenes, ensuring each scene advances the plot and is different from others.
- Avoid repetitive phrases, descriptions, or actions across scenes.
- Respect character gender and age that may be mentioned in the story.

MANDATORY SCENE CONTENT:
- imageDescription: Describe the key elements in the scene, including the location, time, characters, and decor.
- videoDescription: Describe the movement of the objects in the scene, the camera movement, the speed of events, and the character's interactions.
- sceneDescription: Narrative context, character motivations, emotional tone, and story significance. Connect clearly to previous and next scenes.
